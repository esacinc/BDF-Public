### Scope

Enables plain-language queries of biomedical data resources â€“ such as CRDC, ProteomeXchange and Metabolomics Workbench. Provides context-aware insights rather than generic responses. Focuses on resource-specific capabilities instead of duplicating broad search functions.	
### Possible Uses

- Identify relevant datasets
- Explore cohort attributes
- Investigate specific genes
- Understand the protein expression data
- Identify and integrate multi-modal data
- Explore other data resources and data types
- Perform correlation analysis	
### Currenly available data sources

- Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)
- Genomic Data Commons (GDC)	
### Limitations

- **LLM Contextual Limitations:** All LLMs have a finite context window. Long or complex conversations might require truncation or summarization. 
- **Visualization Complexity:** The scope of graph generation is limited to commonly used visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatterplots, heatmaps). Complex custom visualizations are not be supported in the initial version.
- **User Interface Platform:** The user interface is primarily designed for desktop use and may not be fully optimized for mobile devices.
